A toolkit for Multiple Free-Alignment Sequence  Analysis


Recently some alignment-free sequence comparison methods have been introduced based on promoter-frequency distance measures and statistical distribution distances. This paper reports on a new approach devoted to illustrate an efficient web interface, wkTuple, implementing alignment-free sequence analysis using several alternative techniques for representing and quantifying between sequence distances and sequence variability. Specifically, the wkTuple service includes the following techniques: locational k-tuple, naive k-tuple, and a kind of CV-Tree. To support open-science and facilitate collaboration and research reproducibility, the entire project is implemented in pure JavaScript and R. In addition to computational web-service enabling alignment-free sequence pro-
cessing and execution, we provide GitHub open-source codes and protocols supporting collaboration, intendent validation, and resource expansion by the transdisciplinary community.
